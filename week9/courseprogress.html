    <h4><a href='https://filipacalado.com'>Professor Filipa Calado</a></h4>
    <h3> Course Description</h3>
    <p>This foundational course focuses on the intersection of people, information, and 
       technology and the theoretical and conceptual foundations of the information field. 
       Students will be introduced to ideas and concepts that will inform future specializations 
       in their course of study and provide them with concrete strategies for ongoing professional 
       growth and development in their area of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
        This section is taught from a critical perspective, which attends to structures of power
        in our concepts, actions, and social systems. Each week, we'll consider topics in the broad
        field of information through such lenses as intersectionality, capitalism, feminism, social 
        justice, and colonialism.

<h3> Course Description</h3>
<p>This is an introductory course to key concepts, systems, 
    and tools to organize, provide access to and share information resources. 
    The course covers basic principles and applications of descriptive cataloging, classification, 
    and indexing for physical and digital resources. Also covered are metadata, 
    thesauri and emerging knowledge organization systems and practices, including 
    linked data and social tagging. It will provide an introduction to the ways these systems 
    are impacted by cultural biases which may require reparative or remediation work. 
    The course provides the foundation for further studies in library, archive, and museum cataloging, 
    reference, information retrieval, database management, and information architecture.
</p>
<h3> Course Goals</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        To introduce students to principles, standards, and techniques used to organize both printed and 
        digital information resources in libraries and other information environments including:
       <ul>
        <li>
        Bibliographic control and cataloging standards (e.g. RDA, ISBD, FRBR, BIBFRAME) 
        </li>
        <li>
        Metadata standards and applications (e.g., Dublin Core)
        </li>
        <li>
        Classification and indexing systems (e.g, Dewey, LCC, LCSH)
        </li>
        <li>
        Vocabulary control tools (e.g., LC/NAF, VIAF)
        </li>
        <li>
        Emerging Knowledge Organization Systems (e.g., Folksonomies, Linked Open Data)
        </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        To gain an understanding of the best practices in applying concepts and standards introduced and to provide practical experience using professional cataloging tools.
    </li>
    <li>
        The objectives of the course will be achieved through a series of lectures and presentations, including guest speakers, required and optional readings, examination and comparisons of knowledge organization systems, in-class discussions, lab sessions, homework assignments and a final group project.
