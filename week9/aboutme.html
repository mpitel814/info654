    <p class="paragraphstyle">
      Maria Pitel is an MLIS candidate at Pratt Institute. She graduated with a degree in Art History and a minor in Information Technology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2024. During her undergraduate career, Maria interned at several art galleries and museums, completed a number of independent studies, and assisted as an instructional designer for the Department of Art History at UMass. Upon graduating, Maria worked as an Assistant to the Administrator at Green Meadow Waldorf School, a Waldorf school she attended from Grades 2 through 9. Upon moving to Brooklyn in August 2025, Maria began her graduate studies at Pratt and her new role as Executive Assistant and Lower School Librarian at the Rudolf Steiner School. Maria is navigating the ups and downs of children’s librarianship, exploring new ways to engage kids in the library and encourage a love of reading.

      Maria’s current apartment in Brooklyn is fabulous - it has a lot of windows and light, is very noisy, and is slanted (so much so that the bathtub doesn’t fully drain and anything you bake in the oven comes out crooked). When she has the time, Maria enjoys reading, knitting, and painting. Looking forward, Maria hopes to delve deeper into information technology, systems administration, and maybe metadata librarianship.
